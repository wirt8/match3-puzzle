# Project Structure Feedback

## Advantages

1. **Feature-Based Organization**  
   Scripts are grouped into folders like `Board`, `Controllers`, `UI`, etc., improving code navigation.

2. **Unity Conventions**  
   Uses standard folders like `Assets/Resources`, `Assets/Scenes`, and `Assets/Scripts`; assets like prefabs and textures are well-separated.

3. **Third-Party Isolation**  
   DOTween is contained within its own folder.

4. **Meta Files Present**  
   Essential for Unity's asset tracking.

## Disadvantages

1. **Redundant Folder Names**  
   `Utilities` vs `Utility` is unclear.

2. **Flat Script Grouping**  
   Some folders (e.g., `Controllers`) may grow cluttered; logic and data are mixed in `Board`.

3. **Resources Usage**  
   Over-reliance on the `Resources` folder.

4. **No Editor/Test Separation**  
   Editor scripts aren't isolated; no dedicated test folder.

5. **Lack of Architecture**  
   Data, logic, and UI are intermixed;

6. **No General Plugins Folder**  
   Third-party assets could be moved to a `Plugins` folder.
